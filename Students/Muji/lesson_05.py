# Lesson 5 Homework assignment
# Python Classes 
# Object-oriented programming is one of the
# most effective approaches to writing software. In object-oriented programming you
# write classes that represent real-world things
# and situations, and you create objects based on these
# classes. When you write a class, you define the general
# behavior that a whole category of objects can have.

Ex.5.1 
Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant . The __init__() method for
Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type .
Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of
information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indi-
cating that the restaurant is open.
Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attri-
butes individually, and then call both methods.
